	<p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or potatoes in certain regional varieties. The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means 'fried before cooking'. It is a popular dish that has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.</p>
